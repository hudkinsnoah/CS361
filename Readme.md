The server will have a few tables set up. The table that I will be using to send information to is the table named “finaltab”. This will have three different headers as follows: 

**numbercorrect** _(Int data)_	**numberofquestions** _(Int data)_	**percentage** _(Char data)_

To request this data, SQL queries are used:

	To pull all information from the table use: SELECT * FROM finaltab

	To pull a specific column’s data use: SELECT columnheader FROM finaltab

Their shouldn’t be any need to edit the data that is in the table so that information is not included
